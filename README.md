# Real Estate Landing Page

This project is a landing page for a real estate agency created with React and Node. Its main goal is to capture leads, and both the frontend and backend are deployed on [onrender](https://onrender.com/).

## Features

- **Frontend:** Built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for potential clients to submit their information.

- **Backend:** Developed with Node, ensuring proper handling of lead data. Nodemailer is utilized for sending notifications to users, confirming the successful receipt of their submitted information. Simultaneously, the backend notifies the property owner of the new lead.

- **Google Sheets Integration:** The project uses the Google API to store lead information in a Google Sheets document. This integration streamlines the process for the real estate company to personally connect with interested users.
